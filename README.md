For some reason, the grid index did not match up to the expected [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6, 7, 8], and instad is [1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 0, 7, 4, 8], and therefore when hardcoding the winning combinations, I utilized the indices accordingly.

Game clears accordingly when someone wins, and starts a new game. However, at the start of the new game, players can't play anymore...?
